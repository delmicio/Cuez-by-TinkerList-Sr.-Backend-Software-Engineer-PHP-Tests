# Position Handling for Episode Parts in PHP Applications

### **Question 1: What potential actions do you identify as requiring a recalculation of positions in the Parts linked to the Episode?**

**Answer:**

The following actions require recalculation of positions in the Parts linked to an Episode:

1. **Adding a Part at a Specific Position:**
    - **Description:** When a new Part is inserted at a specific position within an Episode.
    - **Recalculation Required:** All existing Parts at the insertion position and beyond must have their positions incremented by 1 to make room for the new Part.

2. **Deleting a Part:**
    - **Description:** When an existing Part is removed from an Episode.
    - **Recalculation Required:** All Parts positioned after the deleted Part must have their positions decremented by 1 to fill the gap left by the deletion.

3. **Moving/Reordering Parts:**
    - **Description:** When a Part is moved from one position to another within the same Episode.
    - **Recalculation Required:** Positions of Parts between the old and new positions need to be adjusted accordingly. This can involve incrementing or decrementing positions based on the direction of the move.

4. **Bulk Sorting/Reordering of Parts:**
    - **Description:** When multiple Parts are reordered, such as through drag-and-drop functionality in a user interface.
    - **Recalculation Required:** All affected Parts must have their positions updated to reflect the new order.

### **Question 2: What API Request payload structure would you use to reliably place the Parts in the position they should end up on? Consider separate endpoints to add, delete and sort Parts.**

**Answer:**

To manage Parts effectively, we need well-defined API endpoints with clear payload structures for adding, deleting, and sorting Parts. Here’s an [OpenAPI example](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/delmicio/d1cd7d43ccbb1552d3c820cd2a886ac1/raw/c7d84fd756703dbfa06d42f98ee68852ec0ca60d/openapi.yml) and how we can structure them:

### **1. Adding a Part**

**Endpoint:**

```
POST /episodes/{episode_id}/parts
```

**Payload:**

```json
{
    "position": integer, // Optional; if omitted, the Part is added at the end  
    "part_data": { ... } // Additional data for the new Part
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `position` field specifies the desired position of the new Part within the Episode.
- If `position` is not provided, the Part is appended to the end.
- The `part_data` object contains any additional information required to create the Part.

### **2. Deleting a Part**

**Endpoint:**

```
DELETE /parts/{part_id}
```

**Explanation:**

- The Part to be deleted is identified by its unique `part_id`.
- No payload is necessary; all required information is in the URL.

### **3. Moving/Reordering a Part**

**Endpoint:**

```
PUT /parts/{part_id}/position
```

**Payload:**

```json
{
    "new_position": integer
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `new_position` field specifies the new position for the Part.
- The endpoint updates the Part’s position and recalculates positions of affected Parts.

### **4. Bulk Sorting/Reordering Parts**

**Endpoint:**

```
PUT /episodes/{episode_id}/parts/order
```

**Payload:**

```json
{
  "part_ids": [part_id1, part_id2, part_id3, ...]
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `part_ids` array represents the desired order of Parts by their IDs.
- The server updates the `position` of each Part to match the order in the array.

### **Question 3: Implement the calculation of the new positions for Parts when changes are performed that affect them.**

**Answer:**

Below are PHP code snippets demonstrating how to handle position recalculations when adding, deleting, and moving Parts. These examples use pseudo-code for database interactions, which should be replaced with actual database code (e.g., using PDO or an ORM like Eloquent in Laravel).

### **1. Adding a Part at a Specific Position**

```php
function addPart($episode_id, $position = null, $part_data) {
    // Start a database transaction
    beginTransaction();

    try {
        // Determine the position for the new Part
        if ($position === null) {
            // Get the current maximum position for the Episode
            $position = getMaxPosition($episode_id) + 1;
        } else {
            // Increment positions of Parts at or after the desired position
            incrementPositions($episode_id, $position);
        }

        // Insert the new Part
        $part_id = insertPart($episode_id, $position, $part_data);

        // Commit the transaction
        commitTransaction();

        return $part_id;
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        // Roll back the transaction in case of error
        rollbackTransaction();
        throw $e;
    }
}

// Helper functions
function getMaxPosition($episode_id) {
    // Query to get the maximum position for the given Episode
    return DB::table('parts')
             ->where('episode_id', $episode_id)
             ->max('position') ?? -1;
}

function incrementPositions($episode_id, $start_position) {
    // Update query to increment positions
    DB::table('parts')
      ->where('episode_id', $episode_id)
      ->where('position', '>=', $start_position)
      ->increment('position');
}

function insertPart($episode_id, $position, $part_data) {
    // Insert the new Part and return its ID
    return DB::table('parts')->insertGetId([
        'episode_id' => $episode_id,
        'position'   => $position,
        // Include additional Part data as needed
    ] + $part_data);
}
```

### **2. Deleting a Part**

```php
function deletePart($part_id) {
    // Start a database transaction
    beginTransaction();

    try {
        // Retrieve the Part to be deleted
        $part = DB::table('parts')->where('id', $part_id)->first();
        if (!$part) {
            throw new Exception('Part not found.');
        }

        // Delete the Part
        DB::table('parts')->where('id', $part_id)->delete();

        // Decrement positions of Parts after the deleted Part
        DB::table('parts')
          ->where('episode_id', $part->episode_id)
          ->where('position', '>', $part->position)
          ->decrement('position');

        // Commit the transaction
        commitTransaction();
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        // Roll back the transaction in case of error
        rollbackTransaction();
        throw $e;
    }
}
```

### **3. Moving/Reordering a Part**

```php
function movePart($part_id, $new_position) {
    // Start a database transaction
    beginTransaction();

    try {
        // Retrieve the Part to be moved
        $part = DB::table('parts')->where('id', $part_id)->first();
        if (!$part) {
            throw new Exception('Part not found.');
        }

        $old_position = $part->position;

        if ((int)$new_position === (int)$old_position) {
            // No action needed
            commitTransaction();
            return;
        }

        // Determine the range of positions to adjust
        if ($new_position > $old_position) {
            // Moving down: decrement positions between old and new positions
            DB::table('parts')
              ->where('episode_id', $part->episode_id)
              ->whereBetween('position', [$old_position + 1, $new_position])
              ->decrement('position');
        } else {
            // Moving up: increment positions between new and old positions
            DB::table('parts')
              ->where('episode_id', $part->episode_id)
              ->whereBetween('position', [$new_position, $old_position - 1])
              ->increment('position');
        }

        // Update the Part's position
        DB::table('parts')
          ->where('id', $part_id)
          ->update(['position' => $new_position]);

        // Commit the transaction
        commitTransaction();
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        // Roll back the transaction in case of error
        rollbackTransaction();
        throw $e;
    }
}
```

### **4. Bulk Sorting/Reordering Parts**

```php
function reorderParts($episode_id, $part_ids_in_order) {
    // Start a database transaction
    beginTransaction();

    try {
        // Validate that all provided Part IDs belong to the Episode
        $count = DB::table('parts')
                   ->where('episode_id', $episode_id)
                   ->whereIn('id', $part_ids_in_order)
                   ->count();

        if ($count != count($part_ids_in_order)) {
            throw new Exception('Invalid Part IDs provided.');
        }

        // Update positions in bulk
        foreach ($part_ids_in_order as $position => $part_id) {
            DB::table('parts')
              ->where('id', $part_id)
              ->update(['position' => $position]);
        }

        // Commit the transaction
        commitTransaction();
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        // Roll back the transaction in case of error
        rollbackTransaction();
        throw $e;
    }
}
```

**Notes:**

- **Transactions:** Using transactions ensures that the database remains consistent even if an error occurs during the process.
- **Concurrency:** Implementing optimistic locking (e.g., using version numbers or timestamps) can help manage concurrent modifications by multiple users.
- **Indexes:** Ensure that indexes are in place on `episode_id` and `position` columns to optimize query performance, especially when handling large numbers of Parts.

### **Question 4: Do you have another approach on how this can be tackled efficiently and reliably at scale?**

**Answer:**

Yes, an alternative approach to handling positions efficiently at scale involves using a **non-integer positioning system** or **relative ordering**, reducing the need for recalculations when inserting or deleting Parts. Here are two methods:

### **1. Using Floating-Point Numbers or Decimals for Positioning**

**Concept:**

- Instead of using integer positions, assign positions using floating-point numbers.
- When inserting a new Part between two Parts, assign it a position that is the average of its neighbors.

**Implementation Example:**

- **Existing Positions:** Part A (position 1.0), Part B (position 2.0)
- **Insert New Part C between A and B:**
    - New position for Part C: (1.0 + 2.0) / 2 = 1.5
    
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f4d70a8-2eeb-4873-a90b-12d0b67c45f3)

**Advantages:**

- **Minimal Updates:** Inserting a Part does not require updating positions of other Parts.
- **Scalability:** Efficient for Episodes with a large number of Parts, as it reduces database write operations.

**Considerations:**

- **Precision Limits:** Repeated insertions may lead to positions that are very close together, potentially causing precision issues.
- **Normalization:** Periodically reassign positions to normalize values and maintain precision.

### **2. Using Linked List Pointers**

**Concept:**

- Implement Parts as nodes in a linked list by adding `next_part_id` and `prev_part_id` columns to the `parts` table.
- Each Part knows its successor and predecessor.

**Implementation Steps:**

- **Insertion:**
    - Update the `next_part_id` of the preceding Part and the `prev_part_id` of the following Part to point to the new Part.
- **Deletion:**
    - Adjust the `next_part_id` and `prev_part_id` of neighboring Parts to bypass the deleted Part.

**Advantages:**

- **Efficient Updates:** Only adjacent Parts need to be updated during insertions or deletions.
- **Order Integrity:** Maintains explicit relationships between Parts.

**Considerations:**

- **Complexity:** More complex to implement and maintain, especially in ensuring data integrity.
- **Traversal:** Retrieving the full list of Parts in order requires traversing the linked list, which can be less efficient than using positions with indexed queries.

### **Recommendation:**

For an Episode with a large number of Parts and frequent insertions/deletions, using floating-point positions can offer better performance by reducing the number of database updates. However, this approach requires careful handling of precision and may necessitate periodic rebalancing of position values.

**Optimizations:**

- **Batch Operations:** Group multiple insertions, deletions, or moves into a single transaction to reduce database overhead.
- **Indexing:** Ensure proper indexing on columns used in queries (`episode_id`, `position`, `id`) to improve query performance.
- **Concurrency Control:** Implement mechanisms to handle concurrent edits safely, such as version checks or database-level locks where appropriate.

---

### **Conclusion**

By carefully designing the API endpoints, payload structures, and database operations, we can efficiently manage the Parts within an Episode, even at scale. The key is to minimize the number of database writes and ensure that operations are atomic and transactionally safe. Alternative approaches like using floating-point positions or linked lists can further optimize performance for specific use cases.
